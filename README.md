# Simple Chess with AI and UI

Referring to it as 'AI' might seem a bit grandiose for its actual capabilities, but indeed, you can play chess against a bot in a browser window, though currently only in the standard calculation mode as the other modes need some fixing. While it's not flawless, crafting a chess game from scratch is a significant challenge, and I'm proud to have achieved it.
